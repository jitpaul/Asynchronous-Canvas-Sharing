This is a  web based tool where multiple users can share a drawing board and make changes to it in real-time. It also includes an embedded text based chat tool. This application is  modeled on Client-Server architecture and we have extensively used HTML, CSS, SVG, Javascript, jQuery and MYSQL to develop the application. You can find more information about this application in the attached 'Project_Report.pdf' under 'report_pdf' folder.
